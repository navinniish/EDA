# EDA
Hello everyone ! Welcome to my EDA playlist. I'm attaching my file on EDA to make sure that you can get a idea of how EDA works. 
EDA means The term exploratory means exploring and exploratory data analysis means exploring the data and analyzing the data 
and arriving conclusions based on the data. This is a very simple explanation based on my understanding and if we go by 
theoretical explanations EDA meansÂ : In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize 
their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
